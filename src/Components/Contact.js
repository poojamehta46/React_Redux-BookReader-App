        EARTH, OUR HOME planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet
        from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to
        host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest
        planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have
        liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers.
        Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity,
        but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our
        world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.”
